# Electricity Consumption Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether households reduced their electricity consumption after accessing a suite of online energy-saving tools. The data used in this challenge comes from a real-world trial conducted on approximately 85,000 households.

The goal is to improve the targeting of households most likely to benefit from energy-saving advice, leading to enhanced energy economies and improved customer satisfaction.
